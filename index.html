                    <h4>Current</h4>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                      As an Engineering Manager at Box, Inc., leading an
                      internationally distributed team across Poland and the
                      USA, I have the privilege of managing a Rich Content
                      Editor application. One of the primary challenges with
                      this application was dealing with its legacy system. Our
                      team has to balance the need for modernization with the
                      practical realities of working with a system that has been
                      in place for years. To achieve this, we had to break down
                      the project into smaller, more manageable components and
                      prioritize them based on their impact on the overall
                      system. We also had to work closely with other teams to
                      ensure that our updates would not cause any unexpected
                      issues in other parts of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Managing an infrastructure team through a migration from
                      on-premise server infrastructure to a cloud-hosted
                      solution was another challenge. This was a critical
                      project that had a significant impact on our customers,
                      and we had to ensure that we could complete it without any
                      significant disruptions. One particular challenge we faced
                      was with the use of websockets. Websockets allowed us to
                      establish a persistent connection between our servers and
                      our customers' web browsers, which was essential for
                      real-time collaboration and other features. However, we
                      had to be very careful to ensure that our implementation
                      of websockets did not compromise our customers' privacy
                      and security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Maintaining privacy and security for customers' data was a
                      top priority throughout this project, and we had to follow
                      strict protocols to achieve this. We worked closely with
                      our security team to identify potential vulnerabilities
                      and implement appropriate safeguards. We also conducted
                      thorough testing to ensure that our migration to the cloud
                      did not introduce any new security risks. Overall, my
                      experience as an Engineering Manager at Box, Inc. was both
                      challenging and rewarding. I continue to learn a great
                      deal about managing teams across different locations and
                      navigating complex technical projects.

                    <p>
                      At Popmenu I began as a Lead Software Engineer leading a
                      team of 4 Engineers with an embedded Product Manager and
                      Product Desginer. I have since taken on an additional team
                      comprised of 4 Engineers, 2 being off-shore, along with a
                      Product Manager and Product Designer. I also manage 6
                      direct engineers to guide them with reaching their Career
                      Growth, making sure they have everything they need to be
                      successful in their day to day work as well as in their
                      future endeavors.

                      Our team is responsible for 95% of the application

                      Shortly after joining Popmenu and being assigned a squad,
                      we quickly went to work on imrpoving our team processes.
                      We worked together to identify and build our Team Charter
                      so that everyone currently and incoming squad memebers
                      were all on the same page of how we worked as a squad.

                      Library that we are building internally. The long term
                      goal is to completely replace all of our Ruby on Rails ERB

                      Successfully helped lead an initiative to migrate from our

                      initiative makes use of many of the services AWS provides
                      as well as some that are not. I have helped to build out
                      and architect our new platform using Terraform to build

                      Our most recent project was a complete redesign, visually
                      and architecturally, of the Manheim Market Report for our
                      customers to view transaction history for a given Year,
                      Make, Model, Style or VIN. This new experience is a
                      ReactJS frontend with a Ruby on Rails API backend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was involved from day one with the architectural design
                      of this new approach for this application. We chose to use
                      a Rails API backend due to the performance advantages and
                      the current skillset of the team members. The backend API
                      was designed as an Aggregate API that allows for multiple
                      requests to be sent and a single response returned with
                      the payload requested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The React application is a consumer of our backend API,
                      dubbed gateway_api. It also is a consumer of other
                      internal API's within the Manheim family of applications.
                      We use Redux for internal state management. Redux Saga is
                      used for handling side-effects in our store.

                      Mending Soul comes from the healing we have to do as a
                      Planet. It is so very important that we as humans show
                      compassion to one another not just in dire times of need
                      but all the time. Mending Soul hopes to help facilitate
                      those types of interactions.

                      Our immediate focus is to help fulfill the needs of

                      situations where PPE(Personal Protective Equipment) is a
                      must. Phase 1 is to do outreach through Facebook to either
                      fulfill needs where we can ourselves or be able to make a
                      connection between a Request for an Item with a Creator
                      who can fulfill that request. Phase 2 will bring that same
                      model online via a Distribution platform where Creators
                      can go online to find those Requests and make the
                      connection on their own.
